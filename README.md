# Comparing_ML_Algorithms-Heart-Disease-
The key to a fair comparison of machine learning algorithms is to make sure that they are all tested on the same data. This can be accomplished by requiring each algorithm to be assessed on a standardised test harness. Here we will test 6 different algorithms and by Comparing Between them we will find which will best fit and get the least error
