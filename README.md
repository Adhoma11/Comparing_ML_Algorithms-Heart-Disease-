## The key to a fair comparison of machine learning algorithms is to make sure that they are all tested on the same data. This can be accomplished by requiring each algorithm to be assessed on a standardised test harness. Here we will test 6 different algorithms and by Comparing Between them we will find which will best fit and get the least error
## So, For Last we found that the Logistic Regression Classifier is our best-performing model and algorithm for a classification problem, since it provides the highest testing accuracy with a moderate training accuracy, ensuring that there will be no overfitting in this model.
